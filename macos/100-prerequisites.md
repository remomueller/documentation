### 104 MacPorts for best Integration with RVM

While Homebrew is a suitable alternative, this guide works best with MacPorts installed for RVM. This guide recommends the use of MacPorts and will not provide solutions for errors encountered due to using Homebrew.

Install MacPorts here:

https://www.macports.org/install.php

Choose the `.pkg` file for your OS, launch the package installer and follow the instructions provided by the installer.

After running the installer, create a symbolic link to the `port` command:

```
sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/port /usr/local/bin/port
```
